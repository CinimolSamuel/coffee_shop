        <p><strong>Coffee</strong> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from
            certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus.
            From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee.</p>

            </li>
            <p>Arabica is the most popular type of coffee, hands down. Depending on who you ask, many coffee enthusiasts
                prefer using Arabica beans due to its taste. Typically used for black coffee, Arabica beans have a
                sweeter, more complex flavor that you can drink straight. </p>
            <li>
                <h3>Robusta:-</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Robusta is cheaper and stronger. Because of its bitter flavor, you’ll typically see Robusta used for
                espresso drinks and in instant coffee mixes. If your Monday morning is lagging, reach for a cup of
                coffee that uses Robusta beans. Their high caffeine content will wake you right up!</p> <br> <br>

                Does everyone like Starbucks coffee? The answer differs.
                The brand is not known for sourcing and roasting the best coffee beans. Most of their coffee beans are
                dark
                roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. And many consumers, who know their coffee, complain that Starbucks
                coffee has a distinct burnt taste.
                The company knows what the average consumers like – caffeine.</P> <br>

                <br>
                Dunkin' is not as big a brand as Starbucks but they are second in line in the number of stores. But yes,
                the coffee Dunkin' offers is surely somewhat superior to Starbucks. For instance, Dunkin' does not have
                the signature burnt taste in coffee as Starbucks does. The coffee is also cheaper.

                The key difference between the two companies is that Dunkin' is more of a traditional eatery while
                Starbucks is a premium coffee house with greater scope to customise and choose from an extensive menu.
